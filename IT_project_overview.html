    <title>Intro to IT: Team Unsure - Assignment 3</title>

    <h1>IT project: Overview</h1>
	  
	  <p> </p>

		<p><b>Topic</b></p>
	  
	  <p>Our group decided to pursue Ishaan’s recruiting site idea as the group project.  
		  For the project, we decided to make an accompanying website as well as a 
		  smartphone application (both in prototype stages). </p>
	  
	  <p>We would ideally like this site to be used by university students across the state and the country 
		  (as long-term vision) so that they have a cash flow to support their busy and costly lives as students. 
		  A large majority of the consumers would consist of international students.</p>
	  
	  <p>The project is based on an application or a website that is used for recruitment purposes, mainly for students. 
		  This site covers different areas of the recruiting industry, including candidate or employee profiles, job 
		  postings in the applicant's area, as well as mini courses to guide applicants on the kind of knowledge they 
		  need before applying for a particular job. For example, if a position in a liquor store were available, the 
		  applicant could be directed to a course that could provide the applicant with the necessary training, certification 
		  or qualifications to then be able to apply for the position.</p>
	  <p> </p>

	<p><b>Motivation</b></p>
	  
	  <p>The main motivation behind this project is that it connects very well with our current lives as university students. We 
		  strongly feel that all students should have a part-time job alongside their studies so that they can begin gaining 
		  experience and get a feel of a professional workplace before attempting to pursue a career after graduation. </p>
	  
	  <p>However, we are also aware of the difficulties that can arise when applying. Sometimes after you apply for a job, you 
		  never hear from the employer again. We feel there should be a platform where high school and college students could 
		  get more information about prospective roles would be, to better prepare for their job.</p>
	  
	  <p> </p>

	<p><b>Landscape</b></p>
	  
	  <p>Some competitors to our group site would obviously include the major recruiting/job sites which already exist in the market. 
		  This includes sites such as ‘seek’ and ‘indeed’. There are also similar attributes which are evident across both major 
		  sites as well as our group site, specifically being the search bar shown to the user when the first enter the page. The 
		  search bar in the home page, we as a group felt was an appropriate tool to implement as it would help streamline the search for 
		  the user, thus improving the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the site.</p>
