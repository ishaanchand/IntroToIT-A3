			 <p>“Ad-hoc communication (outside of meetings) was better and,
				 in general, there was greater levels of engagement from team members
				 (compared with the previous assignment) however the team’s level of
				 planning and collaboration wasn’t quite as good as I hoped, as there
				 seemed to be little communication between team members that were meant
				 to working on the same parts of the project.</p>

			 <p>Unfortunately, as was the case with the previous assignment,
				 contributions have still been somewhat lopsided as while everyone has
				 contributed via the report writing, major sections of the submission
				 were essentially completed by individuals within the group; the project
				 website was created by Sam, the mobile app artefacts were created by
				 Nima and the group web page was created by me.</p>

			 <p>Something which surprised me was the lack of hesitance from Sam in
				 taking on the challenge of building the project mock-up website, as
				 this was likely the most involved task in terms of skills required and
				 sheer work to be done. His engagement in the task may have been boosted
				 by his background interest and aptitude for coding and programming. He
				 attended the task without complaint which I believe is a credit to his
				 character.</p>

			 <p>Something that I learned about groups; everything takes longer to
				 accomplish than would be initially anticipated- I believe this is
				 owing to the varied levels of engagement, focus and motivation within
				 the team, in addition to the individual’s other obligations, such as
				 family, study or work etc."</p>

			 <p>A3 project contributions: made the group webpage, compiled and
				 edited the written work, did the “Tools and Technology” and “Group
				 processes and Communication” write ups, did the “Ideal Jobs / Career
				 Paths” comparison, contributed to the “Skills and Jobs” and “Scope
				 and Risks” write ups.</p>

	 <p>“In Assignment 3 our group has shown a lot of improvement in terms of
		 communication and contribution. Even though we have finished all our given
		 tasks on time if not earlier, there are still areas that we can improve in,
		 like being more efficient in communication or making more meetings with all
		 members present happen more often. I was surprised of how well everything
		 came together on time as we were extremely behind on schedule at the start
		 of the assignment due to members being busy with other subjects.
		 I have learned that the improvements in our chemistry as a group have been a
		 huge factor in our group becoming more efficient with getting tasks done.”</p>

	 <p>“In assignment 3 the group started better with communication, assigning
		 tasks to each team member and checking on what the team members have
		 accomplished each step of the project. We can improve on meeting times
		 aside from that surprisingly we finished on schedule despite commitments
		 with other subjects, at the end I learned that when we come together we
		 did a very good job with our project.”<p/>

	 <p>“Based on the group’s performance for this assignment, the team’s growth
		 is impressive. The level of communication has improved considerably, with
		 members keeping each other updated with their progress and seeking feedback
		 from others with their tasks. Despite having more demanding assignments at
		 the end of the semester, so close to this project, the team performed
		 diligently finished their assigned tasks to a considerable quality.</p>

	<p>Although the team has improved overall, improvements can always be made.
		Despite the team communicating through Teams more than during assignment 2,
		the numbers of meetings were low. I guess the group could have theoretically
		finished the set tasks earlier and spent more time refining the website to
		look more appealing, but the feasibility is rather low. This is due to the
		numerous other assignments due late in the semester.</p>

		<p>What was surprising
		to me was the team’s willingness to help each other despite having their
		own tasks to work on. Experiencing this with this team, makes me want this
		level of helpfulness with future teams I work with.”</p>

	<p>“An area of concern to build upon from the previous assignment was the
		overall communication between group members in between such major
		assignments. I personally feel it’s an issue which was approached well by
		all members of the group. The major components of the task were handled
		well and the final product is something which we can all be pleased with.”</p>

	 <h3>Group reflection:</h3>

<p>As a whole, the group has recognised that there has been an overall
	improvement in our levels of communication and engagement, which has
	occurred in spite of increased study commitments for other subjects as
	well as instances of team member absence due to being unwell after COVID
	vaccination. Fewer meetings were conducted compared to assignment two however
	there was a greater amount of ad-hoc communication done on the fly.</p>

<p>The team has also worked more diligently to achieve its work goals in a
	timely manner and to avoid the stress that accompanies last minute work
	completion and submissions. As with the last assignment the level of focus in
	the team tended to increase the closer we drew to submission date.</p>

<p>An area of opportunity for the group was closer collaboration on the design
	and construction of the project artefacts (website and mobile app) as well as
	increasing the level of feedback offered. It is possible that if more of the
	team were involved in the creative aspects of the project, team engagement
	could improved further.</p>
