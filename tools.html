    <h1>Tools</h1>

		<p>The group has worked to produce mock-up versions of a website and mobile
			applications that would help illustrate how the recruitment project could be implemented.
			The group has used a variety of tools throughout the project; GitHub for
			hosting the mock-up website as well as the group page, Microsoft Teams for communication,
			Atom and Visual Studio Coding for writing HTML (and other code) and Marvel Prototypes for
			the mobile application artefacts.</p>

<p>The GitHub commit trail does not accurately reflect the groups work as not everyone contributed via GitHub.</p>
