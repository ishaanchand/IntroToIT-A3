                    <h1>Motivation</h1>
                    <p> The main motivation behind this project is that it connects very well 
                        with our current lives as a university student.We strongly feel that all students 
                        should have a part-time job alongside their studies so that they can gain experience
                         and get a feel of a professional workplace before attempting to pursue a career after graduation.  
                        However, we are also aware of the difficulties that can arise when applying. Sometimes after you apply 
                        for a job, you never hear from the employer again, or sometimes even if they are informed of your 
                        application, it is not the message they expected. We feel there should be a platform where high school 
                        and college students could get more than just a job title to find out what their role would be to better
                         prepare for their job. </p>
                        
                    <h1>Landscape</h1>    
                    <p>
                        Some competitors to our group site would obviously include the major recruiting/job sites 
                        which already exist in the market. This includes sites such as ‘seek’ and ‘indeed’. 
                        There are also similar attributes which are evident across both major sites as well as our
                         group site, specifically being the search bar shown to the user when the first enter the page. 
                         The search bar in the home page, we as a group felt was an appropriate tool to implement as it 
                         would help streamline the search for the user, thus improving the overall efficiency and 
                         effectiveness of the site. 

                    </p>
                    <h1> Aims of the Project/Site</h1>
                    <p>
                        One main aim of our site would be to ensure everyone who applies for a job or is looking to hire someone, 
                        is constantly kept in the loop of what is exactly going on with their job position at any given stage.
                         We feel this is a very common problem experienced by individuals including us, therefore giving us a 
                         much clearer idea of how to nullify this issue. 

                        Another aim of this project is to make this as efficient as possible for the user. 
                        This includes for both employee and employer. The employee can upload all of their 
                        credentials when first signing up for the site and this can be saved on the system for 
                        all of their future use. The only time an individual might have to type a long message when 
                        using the site would be while answering the questions which are laid out by certain employers, 
                        as this differs from field to field. 

                        The employer, as soon as they log onto the site will be able to access the information of their 
                        latest applicants of the job advertisements. 

                    </p>
