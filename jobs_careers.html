		<p><b>Jules (Cyber security analyst)</b></p>
		<p>"A role as a cyber security analyst will require skills, knowledge,
			qualifications and most likely certifications. By completing my degree
			with a focus on networking and cyber security, I hope to gain some skills
			and knowledge, as well as qualifications. I will then need to do
			further study to complete examinations and gain certifications in
			fundamental knowledge areas (general IT skills and troubleshooting, networking, cyber security)-
			the certifications I would look to attain would include CompTIA A+,
			CompTIA Network+ and CompTIA Security+. Having both industry certifications
			and tertiary qualifications should (hopefully) provide an advantage when
			looking to enter the IT workforce.</p>

		<p>Working in the industry will allow me to gain experience in the field
			and in time I could look to complete advanced security certifications (along the
			lines of CISSP or CISSM) to allow me to pursue a “senior” or management
			role."</p>

		<p><b>Ishaan (IT services account executive)</b></p>
		<p>“At this moment in time, my ideal career path would be completing this degree in IT at RMIT, concurrently trying to 
			further my knowledge in cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. An internship at a firm would ideally be the 
			next step after the degree and is also something which I'm trying to achieve during my studies in this degree.”</p>

		<p><b>Nima (Cyber security specialist)</b></p>
		<p>“I desire to work in the cybersecurity industry and become a cyber security specialist, 
			I plan to achieve this wish by finishing my IT degree, getting an intern job in a cyber security 
			role in a credible company and working my way up to the top positions by continuously improving and reinventing myself.”</p>

		<p><b>Tommy (IT technician)</b></p>
		<p>“I'm currently focusing on completing this degree. During this degree, I might find a part-time job to gain experience in the industry. 
			When I'm finished with my studies, I'd ideally want to transition to a full-time job wherever I decide to work.”</p>
