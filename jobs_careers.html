		<p><b>Jules (Cyber security analyst)</b></p>
		<p>A role as a cyber security analyst will require skills, knowledge,
			qualifications and most likely certifications. By completing my degree
			with a focus on networking and cyber security, I hope to gain some skills
			and knowledge, as well as qualifications. I will then need to do
			further study to complete examinations and gain certifications in
			fundamental knowledge areas (general IT skills and troubleshooting, networking, cyber security)-
			the certifications I would look to attain would include CompTIA A+,
			CompTIA Network+ and CompTIA Security+. Having both industry certifications
			and tertiary qualifications should (hopefully) provide an advantage when
			looking to enter the IT workforce.</p>

		<p>Working in the industry will allow me to gain experience in the field
			and in time I could look to complete advanced security certifications (along the
			lines of CISSP or CISSM) to allow me to pursue a “senior” or management
			role.</p>
