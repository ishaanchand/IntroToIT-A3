		<h1>IT Project - Description</h1>


	  <h2>Aims</h2>

		<p>One main aim of our site would be to ensure everyone who applies for a
			job or is looking to hire someone, is constantly kept in the loop of what
			is exactly going on with their job position at any given stage. We feel
			this is a very common problem experienced by individuals including us,
			therefore giving us a much clearer idea of how to nullify this issue.</p>

		<p>Another aim of this project is to make this as efficient as possible for
			the user. This includes for both employee and employer. The applicants can
			upload all of their documents and credentials when first signing up for the
			site and this can be saved for future use. The only time an individual might
			have to type a long message when using the site would be while answering the
			questions which are laid out by certain employers, as this differs from field
			to field.</p>

		<p>For employers, they will be able to access the information of their
			latest applicants of the job advertisements they have posted, as soon as
			they log onto the site.</p>

	<h2>Plans and progress</h2>

	<p>The project idea is a recruitment services website and mobile app mostly for
		students and young people- we believe everyone can benefit from having a
		casual or part time job- either while studying or to use the role as a
		springboard to help find other work or roles etc. The site will facilitate
		job hunting by the target user demographic. The service will also include
		job advertisements, applicant/employee profile pages and will also provide
		links to courses for applicants to gain qualifications- for example, if an
		applicant applied for a job in a warehouse, if the applicant lacks certain
		qualifications that are required then the site will provide direct links to
		visit to explore gaining the required qualifications.</p>

	<p>On the "Home" page we have the job search bar where
		job seekers can input the job key words and desired location: the search
		results will be displayed below the search bar. The job seeker can click on
		the desired job then it will take the applicant to a more detailed page
		about the job and if it the job requires certain qualification or licences
		etc.</p>

	<p>The “Contact Us” page is basically a form where the applicants or employer
		can contact the staff for a specific request or any other matters by filling
		the form and submitting it.  “About us” provides information about the service.
		The “Employer” allows businesses or individuals to register or sign-in to create
		a job advertisement and post it. Once an applicant applies for a role, the
		employer will have access to applicants’ profiles, contact information and
		their resume etc to review.</p>

		<p> </p>

	<p>The “Applicants” page can only be accessed via registration or
		signing in- on this page applicants can upload their resumes or other
		documents like qualifications, certifications or licences. Applicants can
		also list their skills, work history or any other information they wish to
		share on their profiles. They can create lists of jobs to apply for later
		and view all the jobs they have applied for previously. </p>

	<p>A user registration page will provide a form where employers and
		applicants can sign up, to access the services the website services. Users
		that are already registered can instead sign in and access their profiles
		and depending on their profile type (applicant or employer) apply for roles
		or post advertisements, accordingly. </p>

	<p>The server side of the website requires programming in PHP for fetching
		and validating forms, passwords and uploading and deleting other documents,
		updating and deleting profiles, and returning request with HTTPS, using FTP
		for file transfer, SMTP for handling emails and Python programming language
		for web-security, HTTPS, SSL, SFTP and firewall configuration.</p>

	<p>A database would be used to store the information created and collected by
		the website and mobile application; such information would include applicant
		and employer profiles, contact information, documents, job advertisements and
		communication to and from the website.</p>

	<p>The website will require paid hosting services to provide the server
		security, firewall and anti-virus services.</p>

	<p>The website is incomplete; server-side programming is required for most
		functions and the database would need to be created and integrated. All the
		webforms that would be created such as “contact us” form, registration form,
		sign-in form, forgot my password form and other documents would need to be
		created and stored on the server. Building the website was difficult as we
		have limited experience with coding but for now we have created the
		client-side using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. </p>

	<p>The website was deemed more achievable for creating a more interactive
		mock-up as opposed to the mobile application. Artefacts were created for
		the mobile application and research was done to explore what technology
		would likely be required if the project was ever to be implemented
		(as detailed in the “Tools and Technology” section).</p>
