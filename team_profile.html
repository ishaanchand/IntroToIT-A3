      	<p>"I come from an English-speaking family of English & Australian ancestry. In my spare time, I enjoy computer gaming and gardening.
        I think my interest in IT was really piqued when cybersecurity started to become a
				more household term, due to an increased occurrence of cyber crime
				against both public and private organisations and an increasing number
				of large-scale cyber security events, such as the SolarWinds hack and
				the compromising of Microsoft Exchange email servers etc."</p>
